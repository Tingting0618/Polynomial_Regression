# Polynomial Regression

A simple way to use a linear model to fit nonlinear data is to add powers of each feature as new features, then train a linear model on this extended set of features.

#### Content Includes:
- Polynomial Regression: Add powers of each feature as new features
- Learning curves: plots of the model’s performance on the training set and the validation set as a function of the training set size (or the training iteration).
